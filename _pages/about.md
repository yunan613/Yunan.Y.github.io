I am currently a Visiting Scholar at [School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/cn), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research focuses on enhancing human interactions with design, technologies, and urban spaces by assessing visual perception, spatial behavior, and emotional well-being. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mirna Zordan](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/about/team/faculty/544.html) of [Future Spaces Vision Lab](https://www.mirnazordan.com/) from School of Design at Southern University of Science and Technology. I was advised by [Prof. Bin Jiang](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/dla/jiang-bin/) of [Urban Environment and Human Health Lab](https://uehh.hku.hk/) from [Department of Architecture](https://www.arch.hku.hk/), The University of Hongkong.
